lisp-moochine
=============

A Lisp interpreter written in MOO code. Hosted on LambdaMOO, as object #83882.
You should be able to port it to your own MOO easily enough: the only external
objects it depends on are $list_utils and $string_utils.

It's got lexical scope, lambdas, and simple arithmatic right now. Eventually it
will get MOO interop - so you can program your MOO objects with glorious LISP-y
syntax!
